# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. We expect all participants in this project—whether contributing code, reporting issues, participating in discussions, or engaging in any other way—to adhere to this Code of Conduct.

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the agent-router-mcp project, including but not limited to:
- GitHub repositories and issue trackers
- Pull requests and code reviews
- Discussions and forums
- Email communications
- Any other spaces created by the project for community interaction

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Being respectful and inclusive**: Treat all individuals with respect, regardless of their background, identity, experience level, or opinions
- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**: Avoid language that excludes or demeans any group
- **Being constructive**: Provide helpful feedback and constructive criticism focused on ideas and solutions, not on individuals
- **Listening actively**: Seek to understand different perspectives and engage thoughtfully with others
- **Acknowledging mistakes**: When you make a mistake, acknowledge it and work to learn from it
- **Respecting boundaries**: Honor others' time, privacy, and communication preferences
- **Supporting newcomers**: Help and encourage those new to the project or open source

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Harassment or discrimination**: Any form of harassment, bullying, or discrimination based on age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, political beliefs, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation
- **Unwelcome sexual attention**: Unwanted sexual comments, jokes, imagery, or advances
- **Violent threats or language**: Threats of violence or violent language directed toward others
- **Insulting or derogatory comments**: Personal attacks, name-calling, or intentionally demeaning remarks
- **Trolling or spamming**: Disruptive behavior intended to provoke or derail discussions
- **Publishing private information**: Sharing others' personal information without consent (doxxing)
- **Other conduct**: Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, as well as when an individual is acting as a representative of the project in public spaces. Examples of representing the project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a project lead or ambassador.

## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Reporting a Violation

If you witness or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by:

- Opening a private security advisory on GitHub
- Contacting the project maintainers directly via email
- Using any other reporting mechanism provided by the project

**All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly.** Reporters will be treated with respect and their identity will be protected whenever possible.

### Consequences of Violations

Depending on the severity and nature of the violation, enforcement actions may include:

1. **Verbal or written warning**: For minor violations or first offenses
2. **Temporary suspension**: Temporary removal from community spaces for moderate violations
3. **Permanent ban**: Permanent removal from the project for severe or repeated violations
4. **Escalation**: Reporting to appropriate authorities when necessary (e.g., for harassment or threats)

Community leaders will make good faith efforts to notify individuals of violations and provide an opportunity for dialogue, except in cases where immediate action is necessary for safety reasons.

## Appeal Process

If you believe you've been unfairly treated or have concerns about an enforcement decision, you may request a review by contacting the project maintainers with a detailed explanation of your perspective.
